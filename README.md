# LaraStack - DAO Design Pattern
Welcome to LaraStack, your one-stop destination for mastering software design patterns! In this topic, we will explore the DAO (Data Access Object) Design Pattern, a fundamental pattern that streamlines data access and separates it from business logic for more efficient and maintainable applications.

## What is the DAO Design Pattern?
The DAO Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the business logic and the underlying data source, such as a database or a web service. It centralizes data access operations within a DAO interface, allowing the rest of the application to interact with data through a consistent and clean API.
